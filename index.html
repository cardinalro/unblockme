    Untitled Page<div>The Cat</div>

<p><br>
Like many programmers, when I see a puzzle, I cannot help thinking "Can I devise an algorithm to solve that" ?
<br>
It is probably the same urge, that drives a cat crazy, when it sees something dangling, to play with it :)
<br>
Then I saw the Unblock Me puzzle, you can read about it here, and many have it on their Android phone.
<br>
Immediately, I started thinking about how to solve that game, too.
<br>
Of course, in a couple of days I managed to write a program, using a depth first search. I did the recursion, the backtracking, I kept a trace of values, like a Stack.
<br>
But when I ran it, it kept running, and running... and running...
<br>
It seemed that the space for searching was something big, almost like the central supermassive black hole of the galaxy :(
<br><br></p>

<div>The Prune</div>

<p><br>
So, i decided i need some imaginative pruning. That is, to eliminate some of the branches of that awful tree.
<br>
What came to my mind ?
When a piece moves, it enters (cover)a new zone, and leaves (uncover)an old zone.
<br>
These zones are, like a piece, the have a length, an orientation, and a position on the table. I thought these might be useful.
<br><img src="zones70.png"></p>

<p><br></p>

<div>The decision functions for pruning</div>

<div>(some horror code will follow)</div>

<p><br>
These functions decide whether I will continue to search from a node, or not.
Of course, I played with some functions, but two remained.
<br>
One says that
<br>
"For a move to be valid, it needs to be historically purposeful"
<br>
Good use was made for these zones I talked about.
So, this function, validates a move if some moves before( remember I keep track of moves) uncover a zone that is covered by this move(the one being tested).
<br><img src="nopurpose.png"><br><br>
Another function, tests whether</p>

<p>"between the current move and an older one of the same piece, are some moves that helps me to do these 2 moves ?"
<br>
So, if between current move, and an older move of the same piece, the pieces are moving unpurposefully(similar to the previous function) the move is invalid.</p>

<p>The idea is that, between the moves of the same piece, one must cover the uncovered zone of the oldest move, and another must leave a zone for the newest move to cover.
<br>
And also, the move that covers must be older that the one that uncovers.

<div>Happy end</div>

<p>So, i ran the program, and voila ! It solves all the puzzles that I thrown at it.
<br>
Examples :
<a href="out643f.cs">643</a>
<a href="out743f.cs">743</a>
<a href="out750f.cs">750</a>
puzzles
<br>
The source code is a plain C# named <a href="unblme.cs">unblme.CS</a>, can be compiled with any .NET Framework's CSC
<br>
The command line to run this executable is unblme file.txt, where the input file is like this <a href="in750.cs">file.txt</a>
<br></p>

<div>Enjoy!</div>
